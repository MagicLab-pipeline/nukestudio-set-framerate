### Fix for the original "[Set Frame Rate Bin view menu](www.nukepedia.com/hiero/python/set-frame-rate-bin-view-menu)" by Antony Nasce.

Updated to use PySide2

### Installation
setFrameRate.py - adds a Right-click menu to the Project Bin view, allowing multiple BinItems (Clips/Sequences) to have their frame rates set.
